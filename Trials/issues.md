# issues

camelot:
1. Grid lines are necessary for maximum efficiency
2. flavour 'stream' doesnt work properly even if it is giving better output than normal. Every new line is considered as a new cell in csv.
3. In pdf it is considering all the table attributes. In praxir it is considering the table head i.e even the ones above the black row.
